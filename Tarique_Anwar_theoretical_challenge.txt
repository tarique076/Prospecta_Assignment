Prospecta Theoretical Challenge

Q1) How will you tackle the challenge above?

Solution:- 
-> To tackle the above challenge, we can use the Scanner class in java to read the
csv file by specifying the location of csv file while declaring the scanner
and using new File() constructor.

-> Then we can perform the operations according to the given statements and formulae
to get the desired result.

-> After this we can use FileWriter class and the write method present in this
class to write on the csv file and provide the output.


Q2) What type of errors you would you check for? 

Solution:- 
We can get the File not found exception if we provide a wrong name or wrong location 
of the .csv file.


Q3) How might a user break your code?

Solution
--> A user might break the code if he deletes the .csv file or changes the 
location of the .csv file or even if he renames the .csv file.
If any of these happens, we would get the file not found exception.
